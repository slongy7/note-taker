## Note Taker

## Application

This application is a note taker, which allows the user to create a list of notes of things they need to complete.  This list is then saved on the left side of the screen until they are deleted.  A very useful tool in my life.

## BUGS!

I was unable to finish this homework.  I had it styled and working after my tutoring session, and then when I attempted to post it to Heroku for the link, the CSS style went away, and an error showed up.  I'm very disappointed in my performance on this one, since I was very close to completing it.

## Credits

I had a tutor and multiple TA sessions try and help me fix my bug, and was unsuccessful.  Hopefully what I posted onto GitHub shows how close I was aside from posting through Heroku.
